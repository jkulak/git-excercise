GIT ninja

# Foreword

After switching from SVN and using git and GitHub for several years, sometimes panicking when I ended up in a detached HEAD state I decided to really understand the tool that I was using. This README.md file is a collection of most important things that I have learned and that allowed me to become fluent in using git. The most important part, that really opened my eyes is how git works under the hood and is described here: [Under the hood](#under-the-hood).

Since it's not a book, nor a tutorial, I try to keep it short and simple, with some paragraphs being only a list of bullet points with most important/interesting/most used things/commands.

Pull requests welcome.

# 1. What is GIT?

Git describes itself as "git - the stupid content tracker" (from the `$ man git`). It means that it doesn't do any magic under the hood - it does exactly what **you** tell it to do.

Apart from many excellent git books and tutorials, you can also `$ man git` to read more about it. 

To read about specific command you can `$ man gut show-ref`.

To see a condensed version of the help, with a list of available options for a command, type `$ git reset -h`.

# 2. Config

Git stores it's configuration in three places (for different scopes): system (applied to all users on the system), global (applied to all user's repositories) and local (per project).

* System config is stored in `/etc/gitconfig` and you need admin rights to modify it
* Global config is stored in user's home directory in `~/.gitconfig`.
* Local configs are stored inside your repositories in `project/.git/config`.

Configuration from local config overwrites the global configuration that overwrites the system configuration.

To add/modify configuration settings, you can either edit the files directly, or use git `config` command.

Use `$ git config --global user.email "jakub.kulak@gmail.com"` to add/change e-mail address you want to use with your commits.

Switches `--local` (default), `--global`, `--system` will apply changes to appropriate repository.

## Aliases

Config is where you can define your aliases. Alias is a name for a longer command that you might be using more often.

I like to see my git logs with more details, so instead of writing `$ git log --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit --graph --decorate --date=relative` every time, I have defined an alias for that command in my global config file by writing `$ git config --global alias.lg "log --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit --graph --decorate --date=relative"`.

Now every time I run `$ git lg` in any of my repositories, I will see the log formatted the way I like it.

Other examples of aliases I'm using, can be found here: [Custom aliases for displaying logs](#https://github.com/jkulak/my-config-files#add-custom-aliases-for-displaying-logs)

# 3. Customise your environment

1. Copy and paste the snippet of your choice into the configuration file
2. If you are updating your bash configuration file, remember to `$ source ~/.bash_profile` for the changes to take effect

## Customise your prompt

In your bash configuration file (~/.bash_profile in my case):

```bash
# You need to download download the file from:
# https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh

source ~/.git-prompt.sh
PS1='\u, \W $(__git_ps1 "\e[30;42m(%s)\e[m ")\e[0;35m$\e[m '
```

## Add custom aliases (for displaying logs)

In your ~/.gitconfig file:

```bash
[alias]
    ll = log --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit
    lg = log --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit --graph --decorate --date=relative
    lgt = log --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr)%Creset' --abbrev-commit --date=relative
    lgtt = log --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr)%Creset' --abbrev-commit --date=relative
    lgf = log --graph --all --format=format:'%C(bold blue)%h%C(reset) - %C(bold green)(%ar)%C(reset) %C(white)%s%C(reset) %C(bold white)â€” %an%C(reset)%C(bold yellow)%d%C(reset)' --abbrev-commit --date=relative
```

## Enable autocompletion

In your bash configuration file (~/.bash_profile in my case):

```bash
# You need to download download the file from:
# https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash

source ~/.git-completion.bash
```

# Under the hood

Git data model.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph
http://eagain.net/articles/git-for-computer-scientists/

.git/refs/heads

How git stores files (objects directory + graph)
- DAG directed acyclic graph
- hash, 40 characters, sha-1, globally unique
- 4 types of files stored in objects (blob, tree, commit, tag)
- `git cat-file -p d3f732a` to view the commit content
- `git cat-file -t d3f732a` - to check the type of the object
- `git rev-parse df4s` - to display the full hash
- `git rev-parse HEAD~` - to display the full hash

`git show-ref` - see the list of refs
`git show-ref | grep tags` - list tags
`git show-ref | grep heads` - list branches

`git show --pretty=raw HEAD`
`git cat-file -p d3f732a` or HEAD

(Side note: `$ while :; do clear; ls .git/objects -a; sleep 2; done`)

# Reference shortcuts

* HEAD == "the commit I'm currently sitting"
* HEAD^ == "this commit's father"
* HEAD^^ == "this commit's grandfather"
* HEAD^^^ == HEAD~3
* HEAD^^^^^ == HEAD~5
* HEAD~ == HEAD~1 == HEAD^
* master^^ == master~2

# Git file sections

File stages (working trees, staged, committed, pushed)

It's a working tree, because it's a *tree*  and it's your current working area.

Index (old name) = Staging area

# What is

## Detached HEAD

...

## Fast-forward

Fast-forward merge doesn't create extra commit for merging the changes (like GitHub pull request does), and keeps the history linear.

# Commands

## add

* proper way to add files (better than `add .`)
* `$ git add -p` (--patch) - interactive add

## bisect

Run bisect on 1000 commits to find when the line disappeared.

## branch

* `$ git branch -a` - include remote branches
* `$ git branch -v` - verbose, include hashes
* `$ git branch branch_name` - create a branch

## checkout

* checkout with HEAD~4
* `$ git checkout branch_name` - ...
* `$ git checkout -b branch_name` - ...

## cherry-pick

* `$ git cherry-pick hash` - to copy the commit to current branch

## commit

* `$ git commit --amend`

## diff

`git diff --staged` (older alias --cached) staging area <-> HEAD
`git diff HEAD` - workspace <-> HEAD (all changes from the last commit)
`git diff` - workspace <-> staging area

## fetch

* `$ git fetch` - to read the data from origin

## merge

* `(master) $ git merge feature` - applies all changes on top of master changes and creates a merge commit* (*depends on --no-ff)
* `$ git merge --abort` - cancel the merge

## rebase

* `(my_feature) $ git rebase master` - applied all changes from master before feature changes

- don't overwrite public history
- only rebase on local branches, before pushing
- `git rebase branch --exec "gulp test"`

1. Rebase branch over master
2. Rebase -i to clean the history

## reflog

Your friend when you are lost (and that can happen often when you are rewriting history).

* `$ git reflog` - to see the list of hashes with the last actions

## reset

* `$ git reset HEAD~` - unstage files, keep working tree (uses --mixed as default)
* `$ git reset --soft HEAD~` - keep files staged, keep working tree
* `$ git reset --hard HEAD~` - unstage files, clear working tree (deletes files)

- git reset --hard to any commit in any branch to move head there

## revert

...

## stash

- stash
- pop
- list

# Rerere

* config rerere.enabled true
* true to reuse recorded resolution (in case there will be many same conflicts while merging)

# Popular use cases

## Create a branch from a previous commit

1. `git checkout HEAD~5` - enter detached head state
2. make some changes
3. `git checkout -b new_branch`

# How to undo things

## Undo last commit
See: [reset](#reset)
...
## Unstage file

* `$ git reset file_name`

## Unstage everything

* `$ git reset`

## Recover deleted file (already staged)

1. `$ git reset -- <file>` - this restores the file status in the staging area
2. `$ git checkout -- <file>` - then check out a copy from the staging area

Use `--` to split commands from parameters

## Recover lost commit

1. `$ git reflog` - to see the list of hashes with last actions
* `$ git checkout hash` - to look around if that's what you need (enters detached HEAD state)
* `$ git checkout my_branch` - to move to the branch you want to fix
* `$ git reset --hard hash` - to move it to the desirable state

# Handy commands

* `$ git checkout -` - checkout last used branch
* `$ git grep keyword` - greps directory returning results with searched keyword, ignores files in your _.gitignore_ by default

# Git workflows

Branching strategies?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to6tIdy5rNc

- merging
- rebasing
- --no-ff
- pull request (GitHub)

# Prepare your code for commit

...

# Great commit messages

...

# Good practices

* When pulling from origin use `$ git pull --rebase` - to put your changes on top of new remote changes

# Do's and don'ts

- don't rebase master?
- don't rewrite published history
- don't force push (`git push -f`) unless you know _exactly_ what you are doing!

# Aaah moments

- branch is simply a text file that contains in plain text the name of the commit it points to -  branch is just a label
- it's not a sequence of commits, but every commit has a parent

# Scripts

Scripts are located in `scripts` directory. Use them to initiate fake repositories to practice git commands.

## create-commits.sh

Creates given number of files with random names, writes 10 lines with random strings to each and creates a commit for each file. Usage: `./create-commits.sh 20`

# Extra facts

* You can merge from multiple branches, and the merge is called octomerge - this is where the GitHub logo (octocat, previously known as not so corporate friendly octopuss) comes from that name.
